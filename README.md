This is My First Repository.

This repository contains a Book Management System implemented in Java. 
<br>
The system allows users to:
<br>
Add, remove, search, and update book details.
Display books by author or category.
Sort and display books by price or rating.
View all books in the collection.
The program features a console-based interface and uses an array to manage books.
